# AI Session Log - Mini Voxel Engine

**IMPORTANT**: Every AI assistant working on this project MUST read the AI-README.md FIRST and then log their session here.

## How to Use This File

1. **BEFORE starting work**: Read `/AI-README.md` completely
2. **Log entry upon arrival**: Add your session start entry at the TOP of the log
3. **Work on the project**: Implement your assigned tasks
4. **Update log upon completion**: Update your entry with completion status and any notes

## Session Log

### Session 1: Initial Infrastructure Setup
**AI**: Comet (Perplexity)
**Date**: November 10, 2025, 5-6 PM EST
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in MeshBuilder.js (PR #1)
- ✅ Set up branch protection for main branch
  - Configured with Jules AI bypass for automated fixes
  - Required pull requests for all changes
  - Blocked force pushes and deletions
- ✅ Created "Voxel Engine Development" project board
- ✅ Added 5 custom game-specific issue labels:
  - terrain, lighting, performance, rendering, gameplay
- ✅ Created AI-README.md with project goals and AI notes section (PR #2)
- ✅ Created AI_SESSION_LOG.md for tracking all AI visits

**Key Decisions**:
- Jules AI bot whitelisted in branch protection to enable automated improvements
- All game-related labels use distinct colors for quick visual identification
- AI-README serves as institutional knowledge repository
- Session logging mandatory for all AI to maintain continuity

**Notes for Future AI**:
- Project board is linked to the main repo and auto-updates with issues
- Branch protection is now active - all PRs must go through the bot
- The custom labels make it easy to organize issues by game system
- AI-README has a template for documenting sessions - follow it!

**PRs Created**: #1 (conflicts resolved), #2 (AI-README.md)

## Session 2: AI Logging Documentation and Enforcement

**AI**: Comet (Perplexity)
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Time**: 19:11-19:30 UTC
**Duration**: 0.3 hours

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created PR #3 with AI_SESSION_LOG.md including comprehensive logging requirements
- [x] Added detailed PR description explaining mandatory logging structure
- [x] Merged PR #3 to main branch
- [x] Created PR #4 with AI-CHECKLIST.md as one-page quick reference
- [x] Merged PR #4 to main branch  
- [x] Updated AI_SESSION_LOG.md with Session 2 documentation

**Key Decisions**:
- Created AI-CHECKLIST.md as scannable one-page reference to make logging impossible to miss
- Used mandatory language (MUST, CRITICAL) throughout to enforce compliance
- Structured Session 2 to demonstrate logging being used by AI system itself

**Notes for Future AI**:
- AI logging structure is NOW LIVE - all files (AI-README.md, AI_SESSION_LOG.md, AI-CHECKLIST.md) are on main
- Every AI must follow the 4-step process outlined in AI-CHECKLIST.md before, during, and after work
- The mandatory language and file structure makes it impossible to skip logging requirements
- Session 1 and Session 2 serve as examples for all future AI to follow

**PRs Created**: #3, #4
**Issues Created**: None (infrastructure setup only)

*This log ensures every AI assistant contributes to a shared understanding of the project progress.*
