### Session 1: Initial Infrastructure Setup
**AI**: Comet (Perplexity)
**Date**: November 10, 2025, 5-6 PM EST
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in MeshBuilder.js (PR #1)
- ✅ Set up branch protection for main branch
  - Configured with Jules AI bypass for automated fixes
  - Required pull requests for all changes
  - Blocked force pushes and deletions
- ✅ Created "Voxel Engine Development" project board
- ✅ Added 5 custom game-specific issue labels:
  - terrain, lighting, performance, rendering, gameplay
- ✅ Created AI-README.md with project goals and AI notes section (PR #2)
- ✅ Created AI_SESSION_LOG.md for tracking all AI visits

**Key Decisions**:
- Jules AI bot whitelisted in branch protection to enable automated improvements
- All game-related labels use distinct colors for quick visual identification
- AI-README serves as institutional knowledge repository
- Session logging mandatory for all AI to maintain continuity

**Notes for Future AI**:
- Project board is linked to the main repo and auto-updates with issues
- Branch protection is now active - all PRs must go through the bot
- The custom labels make it easy to organize issues by game system
- AI-README has a template for documenting sessions - follow it!

**PRs Created**: #1 (conflicts resolved), #2 (AI-README.md)
