# AI Session Log - Mini Voxel Engine

**IMPORTANT**: Every AI assistant working on this project MUST read the AI-README.md FIRST and then log their session here.

## How to Use This File

1. **BEFORE starting work**: Read `/AI-README.md` completely
2. **Log entry upon arrival**: Add your session start entry at the TOP of the log
3. **Work on the project**: Implement your assigned tasks
4. **Update log upon completion**: Update your entry with completion status and any notes

## Session 2: AI Logging Documentation and Enforcement

**AI**: Comet (Perplexity)
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Time**: 19:11-19:30 UTC
**Duration**: 0.3 hours

**Status**: COMPLETED

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created PR #3 with AI_SESSION_LOG.md including comprehensive logging requirements
- [x] Added detailed PR description explaining mandatory logging structure
- [x] Merged PR #3 to main branch
- [x] Created PR #4 with AI-CHECKLIST.md as one-page quick reference
- [x] Merged PR #4 to main branch  
- [x] Updated AI_SESSION_LOG.md with Session 2 documentation

**Key Decisions**:
- Created AI-CHECKLIST.md as scannable one-page reference to make logging impossible to miss
- Used mandatory language (MUST, CRITICAL) throughout to enforce compliance
- Structured Session 2 to demonstrate logging being used by AI system itself

**Notes for Future AI**:
- AI logging structure is NOW LIVE - all files (AI-README.md, AI_SESSION_LOG.md, AI-CHECKLIST.md) are on main
- Every AI must follow the 4-step process outlined in AI-CHECKLIST.md before, during, and after work
- The mandatory language and file structure makes it impossible to skip logging requirements
- Session 1 and Session 2 serve as examples for all future AI to follow

**PRs Created**: #3, #4
