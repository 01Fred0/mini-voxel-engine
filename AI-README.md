# AI-README - Mini Voxel Engine Project

## Project Overview

This is a procedurally generating voxel engine built as a locally run .exe application. The engine uses Perlin/Simplex noise for terrain generation and supports 3D cave systems.

## Mandatory AI Logging System

**IMPORTANT:** Every AI working on this project MUST:

1. **First interaction:** Read this AI-README.md file
2. **Log all visits:** Record your session in AI_SESSION_LOG.md (visit on entry, visit on exit)
3. **Branch cleanup:** After completing work, delete all branches except main

## Branch Management Instructions

**For all AI contributors - FOLLOW THESE STEPS:**

1. **Create a branch** for your work (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`)
2. **Make your changes** and commit them to your branch
3. **Create a Pull Request** with a clear description
4. **Get the PR merged** to main branch
5. **DELETE THE BRANCH IMMEDIATELY** after merge - do not leave stray branches

### Rationale
Keeping only the main branch reduces clutter and makes the repository easier to navigate for future AI contributors.

### Branches to ALWAYS Delete After Merge
- Any feature branches created for your work
- All patch branches (01Fred0-patch-*, fix-*, etc.)
- Only main should remain active

## Session Logging

All AI sessions must be logged in `AI_SESSION_LOG.md` with:
- Entry timestamp
- Work completed
- Exit timestamp
- Session status

## Current Project Status

- **Infrastructure:** ✓ Configured (Project Board, Labels, Wiki, Releases, GitHub Actions)
- **Main branch:** ✓ Stable and merged with all fixes
- **Branches:** ✓ All cleaned up (only main remains)
- **Documentation:** ✓ Complete (README, AI-README, AI_SESSION_LOG, AI-CHECKLIST)
