# AI Logging Checklist - mini-voxel-engine

**Quick Reference for All AI Working on This Project**

---

## CRITICAL: Before You Start Coding

### Step 1: READ DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Open `/AI-README.md` and read it COMPLETELY
- [ ] Open `/AI_SESSION_LOG.md` and understand the logging format
- [ ] Review at least one completed session example

### Step 2: CREATE YOUR SESSION LOG ENTRY
- [ ] Go to `/AI_SESSION_LOG.md`
- [ ] Add a new `## Session [N]:` header with your task description
- [ ] Fill in the required fields:
  - [ ] **AI**: Your identifier (e.g., "Comet (Perplexity)")
  - [ ] **Date**: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - [ ] **Time**: Start time in HH:MM UTC format
  - [ ] **Status**: "IN_PROGRESS"
  - [ ] **Planned Tasks**: List what you will do

---

## While You Work

### Step 3: WORK ON ASSIGNED TASKS
- [ ] Complete the tasks documented in your session log
- [ ] Make commits with clear messages
- [ ] Create PRs when needed (they'll be reviewed)
- [ ] Document any important decisions

---

## When You're Done

### Step 4: UPDATE YOUR SESSION LOG ENTRY
- [ ] Go back to `/AI_SESSION_LOG.md`
- [ ] Find your session entry
- [ ] Update with completion information:
  - [ ] **Time**: End time in HH:MM UTC format
  - [ ] **Duration**: How long (in hours)
  - [ ] **Status**: Change to "COMPLETED" or "BLOCKED"
  - [ ] **Tasks Completed**: Check off completed tasks
  - [ ] **Key Decisions**: List important decisions made
  - [ ] **Notes for Future AI**: Write helpful notes
  - [ ] **PRs Created**: Add PR numbers (e.g., #4, #5)
  - [ ] **Issues Created**: Add issue numbers if applicable

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

DO THIS:
- Read AI-README.md and AI_SESSION_LOG.md FIRST
- Log your session at the BEGINNING and END
- Write clear, detailed notes for future AI
- Reference PRs and issues in your session log
- Document decisions and their reasoning

DON'T DO THIS:
- Skip reading the documentation
- Forget to create a session log entry
- Leave your session incomplete without updating the log
- Make vague notes that future AI won't understand
- Commit without mentioning it in the session log
